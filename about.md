My name's Ben Dykstra. I am currently a senior at The College of William and Mary in Thrilliamsburg VA, studying Computational Applied Mathematics and Statistics. That's a huge mouthful that basically means I want to be a data scientist. I work primarily in Python, however I have done some work with R and will use the best tool for the job. I'm currently interested in automated geocoding using natural language processing, exploring all of sklearn (ambitious), and extending statsmodels for panel data. My git repository for all of my notebooks is [here](https://github.com/bfdykstra/data-science). That repository includes some notebooks not posted here (yet) and various experiments/fiddling. My homebase is Boston, MA.


Things that I want to learn/continue learning:

* D3 for awesome visualizations
* SQL
* Bayesian machine learning
* More econometric methods
* Methods for Feature Selection
* Data science pipelines
* Ensemble methods



An amazing team and I won a [hackathon](http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2016/william--mary-computer-science-students-win-top-two-hackathon-prizes.php) once. It was really cool and exposed me to what was possible with preparation and a talented team. [This](http://astute-dev.github.io/) is the app that we built.
