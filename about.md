My name's Ben Dykstra. I studied Computational Applied Mathematics and Statistics at The College of William and Mary in Thrilliamsburg VA. That's a huge mouthful that basically means I want to be a data scientist. I work primarily in Python, however I have done some work with R and will use the best tool for the job. I'm currently interested in automated geocoding using natural language processing, exploring all of sklearn (ambitious), and extending statsmodels for panel data. My git repository for all of my notebooks is [here](https://github.com/bfdykstra/data-science). That repository includes some notebooks not posted here (yet) and various experiments/fiddling. My homebase is Boston, MA. Starting summer 2017 I'm thrilled to be heading to Capital One for their 6 month developers academy. From there I'll feed in to their wonderful Technology Development program!


Things that I want to learn/continue learning:

* D3 for awesome visualizations - [Here's](http://stair.wm.edu/TRIP.html) a project I worked on that incorporates D3 force graphs
* SQL
* Bayesian machine learning
* More econometric methods
* Methods for Feature Selection
* Data science pipelines
* Ensemble methods



An amazing team and I won a [hackathon](http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2016/william--mary-computer-science-students-win-top-two-hackathon-prizes.php) once. It was really cool and exposed me to what was possible with preparation and a talented team. [This](http://astute-dev.github.io/) is the app that we built.

I've done some software and android development in Java, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/bfdykstra/Software-Development).
