I am currently a senior at The College of William and Mary in Thrilliamsburg VA, studying Computational Applied Mathematics and Statistics. That's a huge mouthful that basically means I want to be a data scientist. I work primarily in Python, however I have done some with R and will use the best tool for the job. I'm currently interested in automated geocoding using natural language processing, exploring all of sklearn (ambitious), and extending statsmodels for panel data. My git repository for all of my notebooks is [here](https://github.com/bfdykstra/data-science). That repository includes some notebooks not posted here (yet) and various experiments/fiddling. Homebase is Boston, MA.


Things that I want to learn/continue learning:

* D3 for awesome visualizations
* SQL
* Bayesian machine learning
* More econometric methods
* Methods for Feature Selection
* Data science pipelines
* Ensemble methods



An amazing team and I won a [hackathon](http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2016/william--mary-computer-science-students-win-top-two-hackathon-prizes.php) once. It was really cool and exposed me to what was possible with preparation and a talented team. [This](http://astute-dev.github.io/) is the app that we built.

* [Roads to Rome](http://roadstorome.moovellab.com/) - Data Viz/Art of all the roads in Europe that lead to Rome.
* The [culture](https://fivethirtyeight.com/life/) section of 538. One of the main contributors is Walt Hickey who is a William and Mary Math alum. His daily column Significant digits is hilarious.
* [Major Clarity](https://www.majorclarity.com/) - A startup founded by a very good friend of mine that guides students college education with experiential learning.
* [dril](https://twitter.com/dril), [Wu-Tang Financial](https://twitter.com/Wu_Tang_Finance) and [Rob Delaney](https://twitter.com/robdelaney). I love twitter and it is my *only* social media outlet
* Norfolk, VA. I interned here over summer 2016 at ForRent.com with the blossoming data science team. It was a fantastic experience and I highly recommend it.
* [Allen Tate](http://allentatemusic.com/). Give him a search on Spotify and bask in a hot tub of soundwaves.
* [Fear 2 Freedom](https://www.fear2freedom.org/) - An amazing organization that supports survivors of sexual assault.
* Mr. Robot the TV show - A realistically portrayed show about a hacking collective starring Rami Malek. It always keeps me guessing.
* More things that I haven't discovered yet.

I've done some software and android development in Java, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/bfdykstra/Software-Development).
